```bash
cd /Volumes/Storage/Development/dev-launcher
./create-desktop-icon.sh
```

2. Right-click **Dev-Launcher.app** â†’ **Get Info** (or press Cmd+I)
3. In the Info window, click the small icon in the top-left corner
4. Drag your custom icon image onto it

2. Or: Right-click the running app in Dock â†’ Options â†’ Keep in Dock

## Troubleshooting

### App won't open
